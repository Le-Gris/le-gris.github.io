## Overview

This honours research project explores the relationship between categorical perception and category-learning difficulty through computational modeling. The work investigates how different category structures and learning parameters affect the difficulty of category acquisition in both human and artificial systems.

## Research Questions

- How does category structure influence learning difficulty?
- What computational factors predict successful category learning?
- How can we model the relationship between categorical perception and learning?
- What insights can computational models provide about human category learning?

## Methodology

The project involved developing a computational model that simulates category learning processes, testing various category structures and learning parameters to understand their impact on learning difficulty and success rates.

## Key Contributions

- Development of a functional model of category-learning difficulty
- Analysis of the relationship between categorical perception and learning
- Computational insights into human category learning processes
- Open-source implementation for further research

## Academic Context

This work was completed as part of an Honours Research Project at McGill University, supervised by Prof. Stevan Harnad, and represents early work in computational cognitive science and machine learning.
