## Overview

This research investigates the cognitive processes underlying insight problem-solving through the development and analysis of a novel physical reasoning game. The study explores how humans approach complex spatial reasoning tasks and what factors predict successful insight moments.

## Research Questions

- What cognitive mechanisms underlie insight problem-solving?
- How do humans approach complex physical reasoning tasks?
- What factors predict successful insight moments?
- How can we model the transition from impasse to solution?

## Methodology

The study uses a custom-designed physical reasoning game that presents participants with complex spatial puzzles requiring insight-based solutions. Data collection includes both behavioral measures and computational modeling approaches.

## Key Findings

- Identification of cognitive markers that predict insight moments
- Analysis of the problem-solving process and impasse resolution
- Computational models of insight problem-solving mechanisms
- Insights into individual differences in problem-solving strategies

## Impact

This work contributes to our understanding of human problem-solving and has implications for both cognitive science and artificial intelligence, particularly in developing more human-like reasoning systems.
