## Overview

This computational neuroscience project explores categorical perception in human vision through the development and analysis of a biologically inspired computational model. The work replicates and extends findings from the original model developers, providing insights into how categorical perception emerges in visual processing.

## Research Questions

- How does categorical perception emerge in the human visual system?
- What computational mechanisms underlie visual categorization?
- How can biologically inspired models capture human visual processing?
- What factors influence categorical boundaries in vision?

## Methodology

The project involved implementing and analyzing a computational model of categorical perception in human vision, including replication of original results and extension to new experimental conditions.

## Key Contributions

- Successful replication of original categorical perception results
- Extension of the model to new experimental conditions
- Insights into the computational basis of visual categorization
- Open-source implementation for further research

## Academic Context

This work was completed as a term project for a computational neuroscience course at McGill University, demonstrating the application of computational modeling to understanding human visual perception.
